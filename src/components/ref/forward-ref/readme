What are forwardRefs? How to Pass Refs to Child Components. This process is the short-form for Forwarding Ref (reference) where the Child component is receiving the forwarded ref.

Child component: any component that's invoked inside another component.

But what if you need to access a DOM element of a child component? Then a simple ref is not enough and you have to combine refs with React.forwardRef(): a technique called refs forwarding.

React also throws a useful warning: Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?
